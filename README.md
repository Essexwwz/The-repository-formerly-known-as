# HuskySort

For a description of the HuskySort algorithm, please visit https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00866

All codes are in the / result folder, including Pinyin comparator, LSD radixsort, MSD radixsort, dual pivot quicksort, cardinal sorting unit test and all sorting algorithm tests (sorts. Java). Timport uses system sorting.

The huskyport test file is result/src/edu.neu.COE.huskysort.sort/huskysorthuskysortbenchmark.java, retains the sortstrings method, and adds a delay to simulate the process of Chinese character to Pinyin. The config.ini file was modified to meet the project requirements.
